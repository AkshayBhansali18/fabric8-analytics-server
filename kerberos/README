Note: the generated files under krb5kdc/ and keytab/ are meant purely for testing, never use this setup in production!

To regenerate/change the kerberos files under krb5kdc/ and keytab/ directory run do_regenerate.sh (you can optionally change _regenerate.sh and add more principals as you wish).

What's in this directory:
- Dockerfile - Dockerfile for kdc used by docker-compose
- Dockerfile.client - Dockerfile for kerberos-client used by docker-compose
- Dockerfile.regenerate-krb5kdc - Dockerfile used for (re)generating files under krb5kdc/ and keytab/
- do_regenerate.sh - script to run if you wish to regenerate data under krb5kdc/ and keytab/
- firefox - directory with pregenerated Firefox config for kerberos-client container
- kdc.conf - kerberos kdc.conf file
- keytab - directory with pregenerated kerberos keytab that can be mounted to coreapi-server container
- krb5.conf - kerberos krb5.conf file
- krb5kdc - kerberos kdc pregenerated files
- README - this file :)
- _regenerate.sh - file that gets run in container from Dockerfile.regenerate-krb5kdc, initializes kerberos with some default principals and generates keytab (also used in Vagrant box)
